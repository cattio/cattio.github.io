<h2>about fashion cay</h2>
<p>
  Our website was made as the final project for Girls Who Code Software.org/ Georgetown Law
  Summer Immersion Program in August 2019. The name "Phashion Cay" comes from the word fashion
  and our names; Catherine, Alaysha, and Yeira.
  For our website, we used HTML, CSS, and Javascript,
  and hosted it using GitHub pages.
  We used W3Schools a lot for coding reference.
  We used Trello for project management.
  The website was made without a template and uses the "Great Vibes" font from google fonts
  for headings, and Verdana font for text.
  The style quiz and size calculators both use Javascript and were made without templates.
  The store options map uses an embedded custom Google map.
  Size information and pictures are from the H&M website sizeguide.

  <p> Helloooooooooooooo my name is Yeira
    and hope you are enjoying our website. some of the
    key features that I work on was the quiz, logo, and
    finding the stores. I want to take this opportunity to
    bring awareness to SAVING THE TURTLES and provide a
    link if you feel in your heart to donate.

  <p> My name is Alaysha I'm 15 years old and
    I want to be a game developer when I get older.
    On the Phasion Cay website I coded the survey and
    created the map for the styles. My interests are
    games, coding, and editing I'm glad I got the
    opportunity to work on this project with Catherine
    and Yeira. </p>

  <p> During this project, I worked on the stylesheets and general
    styling of the website and put it on GitHub pages. I also made the size calculator with
    Javascript and took the pictures for our about page. I like
    to do photography, be with my dog, listen to music, and hang
    with my friends. In college I will probably study some
    type of engineering.
